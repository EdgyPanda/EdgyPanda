# Hi there,
I'm currently finishing my masters degree in Mathematics-Economics: **Mathematical Finance track** from [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/) and will be done in late December 2020. In general, my main interest is mathematical modelling with applications to finance, which is also how I structured my masters degree. Therefore, I mainly work with:

1. Pricing of exotic derivative contracts (with main emphasis on options) where the underlying follows various jump-diffusion models.
2. Volatility modelling on financial traded products, including forecasting and comparison methods for the purpose of doing portfolio analysis and/or risk management. 
3. Data analytics, for the purpose of transforming raw data into data visualizations and/or tools, to help organizations make more data-driven decisions.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master thesis until late december 2020.
- ðŸŒ± I mainly do statistical coding in **R** and **Matlab**, however I'm working on becoming better at **Python**.
